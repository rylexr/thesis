  abstract = {{The use of visual sensing for action generation in unknown environments
	is an attractive option due to the great representation power of
	vision, but it is challenging for two reasons. The representations
	used in vision are often not well suitable for planning, thus requiring
	complex learning approaches. Furthermore, an active agent needs to
	make decisions on-line, without the delay of off-line processing.
	This paper proposes to combine monocular visual SLAM with dense visual
	reconstruction techniques in order to build geometrically correct
	three-dimensional models, which can be used for action generation,
	such as path or grasp planning in a robotic system. We propose a
	vision only monocular solution which will run on-line on commodity
	hardware. The problem is very challenging and currently no complete
	solutions exist, though similar off-line systems are quite mature.}},
